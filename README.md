Our project uses api's from twitter, youtube and billboard to test the accuracy of billboards hot 100 list.
This is done by comparing the tweets on twiiter and the streams, likes and comments on youtube to determine how popular each song is.
These are then compared to the order which nillboard has determined to test its accuracy.
